# Stock Information


Shell script that CURLs stock info from *marketwatch.com*.
The script has simple functions for markets, commodities and companies that can be called inside the script to output the information.
Output is properly formatted.
Script is slow but good enough if you just want to take a look at prices and not follow them.
You can redirect output to conky,polybar or send notifications according to your needs.  
**MAKE SURE NOT TO RUN THE SCRIPT CONTINUOUSLY AFTER EVERY FEW SECONDS BECAUSE IT PUTS LOAD ON THE SITE.**


There are few examples on how to use it inside the script itself.
Obviously the script can be optimized, I will try to when it's required.
